            Subic Bay is a natural deep-water harbor located on the western coast of Luzon in the Philippines, within the province of Zambales. Once home to one of the largest U.S. naval bases outside the United States, Subic Bay has transformed into a bustling commercial and tourist hub following the American militaryâ€™s departure in 1992. The area was converted into the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, which is now a thriving center for industry, logistics, tourism, and eco-adventure, managed by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA).

            The bay itself is surrounded by lush rainforests and mountain ranges, offering visitors a unique blend of natural beauty and historical significance. Subic is popular for its clean beaches, water sports, and eco-tourism attractions like jungle survival tours, ocean parks, and animal encounters. Historical sites such as former military bunkers and museums also provide a glimpse into its rich past as a strategic naval outpost. With its well-maintained infrastructure, tax incentives for businesses, and proximity to Metro Manila, Subic Bay continues to grow as a destination for both local and international travelers, as well as a center for commerce and innovation.
