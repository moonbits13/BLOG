          Spanish Colonial Period (1571–1898): Fort Santiago served as the premier defense fortress of the Spanish Government in the Philippines.
          It was the headquarters of the Spanish colonial government and housed a military garrison. The fort's dungeons were infamous for holding prisoners,
          including Filipino revolutionaries and political dissidents.

          Japanese Occupation (1942–1945): During World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army used Fort Santiago as a prison and torture
          chamber for Filipino and American soldiers, as well as civilians suspected of aiding the resistance movement.
          Many prisoners perished under brutal conditions, and the fort was heavily damaged during the Battle of Manila in 1945.

          Luneta, also known as Rizal Park, is a historically significant landmark located in Manila, 
          Philippines, covering an area of 58 hectares. Originally established as a promenade in the 1820s, 
          the park was later renamed Rizal Park in 1913 to honor Dr. José Rizal. It was here, on December 30, 1896, 
          that Rizal was executed by firing squad, making the site a symbol of Filipino resistance against Spanish rule.

          At the heart of Luneta is the Rizal Monument, a towering tribute to Dr. Rizal, which contains his remains. 
          The monument is surrounded by landscaped gardens. Luneta also hosts the National Museum, Japanese and Chinese Gardens, 
          an Orchidarium, and a Musical Dancing Fountain with vibrant evening displays.
